# ThreadScheduling
The code will create 4 worker threads. Each thread has its own task execution time, period (deadline), and so on. The user inputs 1 argument. Based on the argument value, the program uses a different scheduling function (0: FIFO scheduling, 1: Earliest deadline first (EDF) scheduling, and 2: Rate-Monotonic (RM) scheduling). 
For example, if 0 is an input argument, then your program should use FIFO scheduling.
